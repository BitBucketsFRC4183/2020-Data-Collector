# 2020-Data-Collector
Robot project that collects data from every motor (encoder positions/velocities, temperatures, currents, etc) in order to extrapolate the equations of motion of the robot in order to properly simulate it. This will let us "work" on the "robot" while maintaining social distancing guidelines :)
